# IsThisModLegit-Web
Web Client of "Is This Mod Legit?" Works for all modloaders on Modrinth. Replaces the original mod.

Font Used: Jetbrains Mono

I plan to also create a miniature mod analyzer (checks for domains contacted, file access, etc) whenever I have bandwidth and proper server setup to host it.

Want to translate the site? PR with a new file as the site translated to your language (e.g. `ko_kr.html`).
